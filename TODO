Instruments are not sorted alphabetically once they're added to a cue.

Inheritance issues:
  Cue 1 has Ins a @50 
  Cue 2(Cue 1) has Ins @60
  Cue 3(Cue 2) sees Ins @50

Cue Edit Cue selection box should be a combo box, not an option menu -- 
  The option menu don't scroll too well.

There should be a button that says, "Make a new cue with me as the parent"

Maybe we should make a bug tracking system. :)
