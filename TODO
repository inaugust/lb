gtk assert, unreproducable
  multiple ins selected in cue edit
  running level up with little button
  gtk critical gtkstyle.c gtk_style_get_prop_experimental 
     assertion file!=null failed line 3931

don't allow opening cue parenting dlg more than once

two programs
  progs A and B use same XF
  first time B uses XF doesn't work

nameserver
  maybe when client exists while faders are running

Maybe we should make a bug tracking system. :)
