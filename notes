ways to resolve dimmer control conflicts:

- dimmer stores level spec'd by each control, decides what to do
  internally
  - con:
    - effects can not be based on actual level of dimmer
    - get_actual_level()

  - when dimmer set:
    - specify source:
      'module'+'.'+'control'
    - specify type:
      min
      max
      add
      sub
      capture
      blackout
    - dynamically add more types for more controls

- dimmer must be reserved by a control
  - con:
    - control must be notified that it can not have the dimmer
    - how should decision to allow controls to have dimmer be made

- absolute hierarchy
  - con:
    - packages must know about each other, or user must specify
      hierarchy.
